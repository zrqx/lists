# Languages and Resources

> Disclaimer: The list is heavily biased and is intended to be so

Programming isn't entirely about Programming Languages but we use them to achieve tasks or solve problems. In a vague sense, most programming languages are similar in what they have to offer. Yet, we need to pick one 
We have to choose a Language which has easy syntax and with which we can perform practical tasks as early as possible

The main contenders for this place are Python and Javascript. They both have easy syntax and can be used for variety of tasks

- **Python:** Used to Automate tasks on the Computer (mostly Linux), Write quick scripts for Hacking, Scraping the Web and other endless list of tasks
- **Javascript:** Geared towards Web Development (towards App Dev as well)

Applications of Python: 
1. Understand the Computer / OS
2. Automate Everything (almost!)
3. Web Development (Not Recommended when compared with JS)

Applications of Javascript:
1. Create Webservers and API's (quickly, without much hassle)
2. App Development

If your goals overlaps with that of the applications of the language, just go with it.

**Resources for Python:**
1. [Youtube ~ Python Beginner Tutorials - Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7)

This Beginner friendly Python tutorial series explores Installation, Basic Syntax, Importing Modules, Interacting with Files. <br>
Limit to first 11 Videos, as we don't get to experience the language first-hand with just the syntax

2. [A Paid Course on Udemy](https://udemy.com)

Paid courses are a necessity at this point because not only will they give structure to our learning but also refrains us from dwelling on things unnecessarily for too long.

We have 2 courses, which are hands-on and focuses on the practical aspect of Python. Choose one based on the Curriculum and the things you have in mind
- [100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023 ~ Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)
- [Learn Python & Ethical Hacking From Scratch ~ Zaid Sabih](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-python-and-ethical-hacking-from-scratch/)

From Corey, we learn the basics which gives us a headstart in these really long, paid and awesome courses by Angela and Zaid respectively! 
These courses introduce us to different modules / packages with an associated project, hence giving us opportunity to explore.

**Resources for Javascript**
- [The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp ~ Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)
- [The Web Developer Bootcamp ~ Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)

Both courses are long and comprehensive. I haven't gone through Youtube Playlists for JS but Hitesh Choudhary, The Net Ninja & FreeCodeCamp will do.
